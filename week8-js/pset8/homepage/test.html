<p>Initializing a variable myIndex and calling the carousel function.</p>
<p>Defining the carousel function, retrieving elements with the class "mySlides" we select all elements and store them in variable "x".</p>
<p>The 'for' loop iterates through all the elements with the class "mySlides" and sets their display property to "none," effectively hiding them.</p>
<p>Increments the variable "myIndex" to move to the next slide.</p>
<p>Checking if the end of slides is reached, and resets when necessary(when "myIndex" exceeds the total number of slides).</p>
<p>Displays the current slide by setting its display property to "block".</p>
<p>Set a timeout to call the carousel function after 3000 milliseconds (3 seconds).</p>
